      <p>We use Google Analytics software to collect information about how you use Service Performance. We do this to help make sure the site is meeting the needs of its users and to help us make improvements, for example, improving user journeys.</p>

      <p>Google Analytics stores information about:</p>

      <ul class="list list-bullet">
        <li>the pages you visit on the site</li>
        <li>how long you spend on each page</li>
        <li>how you got to the site</li>
        <li>what you click on while you’re visiting the site</li>
      </ul>

      <p>We don’t collect or store your personal information (such as your name or address) so this information can’t be used to identify who you are.</p>

      <h1 class="heading-medium">We don’t allow Google to use or share our analytics data</h1>

      <p>Google Analytics sets the following cookies:
        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Name</th>
              <th>Purpose</th>
