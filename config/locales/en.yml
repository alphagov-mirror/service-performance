        <p>These numbers tell you how much the call centre was used, and why.</p>
        <p>If the total number of calls is higher than the number of transactions, that’s an indication that effort is high compared to output.</p>
        <p>If the proportion of users calling to chase progress is high, this might mean that the service isn’t processing transactions as quickly as it should. A high proportion of calls to get more information could indicate that the information available online is incomplete or unclear.</p>
